The quickly steamed collard green is the star of this recipe for sure. Collard greens are better for you than even kale and they have this crazy ability to lower your cholesterol. Ideally one should incorporate 1-2 cups per portion 2-3 times a week or more if you want. Kale gets all the attention but collard greens are where it is at. When shopping for collards look for firm, unwilted leaves that are a vivid deep green with no yellowing. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/77d29c7c-3321-4a04-a7b2-e5dab26d3b1d.jpg)

This is a great example of a budget friendly recipe. It cost me $5.24 for the ingredients so that makes it about $1.31 per patty! I achieve this by buying my spices, grains, and legumes in bulk (lately it has been at Ellwood Thompson down the street) so that I only have to buy a small amount at a time. 

This recipe is also incredibly convenient. You can make a big batch, store some in freezer bags, and enjoy them another week! When you defrost they might be more wet so you can toast some 100% whole grain bread and then grind it up to make a flour and then fry them. Another alternative is to bake it in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. 

Make Ahead Black Beans and Brown Rice Burgers 

Serves: 4
Makes 4 large or 5 medium burgers. 

optional- Freeze half for a busy week.

Ingredients:

1 ½ cups(250g) black beans, cooked 

1 cup(150g) brown rice, cooked 

1 cup (130g) onion, chopped 

1 cup (125g) carrot, shredded 

3 cloves (12g) garlic, minced 

¼ cup (30g) parsley or cilantro, chopped 

1 teaspoon cumin, ground 

1 teaspoon chipotle 

1/2 teaspoon salt 

1/4 teaspoon pepper 

2 Tablespoons olive oil 

1 bunch collard greens, stem cut out 

Instructions: Pulse in food processor - beans, carrots, onion, rice, garlic, parsley, chipotle, salt and pepper until combined. If you don't have a food processor mash up in a bowl with your hands. If needed, add tsp of water at a time until the mixture holds together.
Let mixture rest, refrigerated for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
Form 4- one inch thick patties. (At this point you can wrap and freeze the patties)
To cook Patties: place saute pan over medium heat, coat the bottom of the pan with pure olive oil and once hot place the pattie in the oil.
For the collard greens: heat up a pan with water and blanch the collard greens in the hot water one at a time for 5 seconds each side.
Set aside until ready for wrapping. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ca81d7de-5620-4bf2-9cea-2bb7a02b4e69.jpg)

As you may notice there are more beans than rice in this recipe. Beans are a food that makes you feel fuller longer. Brown rice is a good addition since it retains the bran and germ along with the healthy oils and vitamins.
According to the myfitnesspal app each burger has about 275 calories so you can add a side like baked sweet potato fries, grilled veggies, or a salad.
To watch me make this you can check out my youtube video that I submitted to Jamie Oliver's Food Tube competition. Unfortunately the video (edited by Amanda Tenney) looks to professional and awesome so we didn't win.
